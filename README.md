# esg-analyzer-python
This project is a Python-based tool that performs basic ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) score analysis using mock data. It allows users to input a company name and retrieve key ESG metrics — such as total ESG score, grade, and level — along with a qualitative interpretation of the company’s sustainability performance.
